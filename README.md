# river-dots
Dots for my rice 

Also includes stuff for Fuzzel, Kitty, and Librewolf/Firefox

The pallete used is [Shadotheme](https://github.com/Shadorain/shadotheme).

The kitty theme is slightly different from the one seen in [kitty-themes](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty-themes/), the color used for the background and the one used black have been swapped, this change wasn't added to the kitty themes repository for consistency with the ST theme, and as it was my personal preference.

for the firefox/librewolf theme, install [Firefox Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-color/) and go [here](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAL7AAAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCia2CaaEGccwS-xMDPryBvKUaao_JlnZ-n5w5heCUxRhb7SjuV2WHtCkp3jIZ-ikffLnFKhmI-D-IWveKTyORka_CKXWn8VKC7cvNvVTv1YxFNfLDaI9ryJ3yIF54Qk8JpvTUOnkT-uiOXsb_6RKVer6d65DWkCAZRBvD9K44-kHtFy945oG3y3bw_bfVsrNaX8T6iv57czg)
